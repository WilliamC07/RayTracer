## Proposed Features
- Ray tracing
    - [Online guide](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing)
    - [Another one](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
    - I can expand on this to include more reflection types (transparency, water bending light, etc...), or until
    my computer takes too long to run the program when debugging.
- Supporting .obj texture (when I get ray tracing to work)
    - I already have .obj support from past assignments, and it supports converting quadrilateral faces to 2 triangular faces.
    - Texture mapping 
        - Javascript parsing of **.png** files [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pngjs)
        - Javascript parsing of **.jpeg** files [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpeg-js)
